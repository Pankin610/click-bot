At the moment, project consists of several main files, such as: environments, lang, program... etc.
More or less, each of them is responsible for an integral part of program.

Environment class describes how commands should behave in different situations
(for testing purposes, as desktop or console application, etc).
Abstract environment contains most of default (console) implementation.

'Files' folder is responsible for handling communication with files.

Folder 'gui' contains graphic part of program.

Language folder contains scheme of pseudocode in which result programs can be created.

Program class contains description of resulting program and methods handling reading and saving to a file.

Testing folder exists for testing purposes.

Utility folder contains some handy classes, which may be used in implementation of methods in whole project.

Commands should be implemented in general way, preferably should contain only calls to methods from Environment interface.
