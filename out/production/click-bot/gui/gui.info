Naming convention:
name_od_window.fxml (fxml file, if needed) <=>
NameOfWindowController (Controller, should implement Controller interface) <=>
NameOfWindowWindow (Window implementation, should implement SideWindow interface)

Packages:
application: Main and SideWindows
controllers: Controllers
graphics: Graphic content of project (icons, etc.)
scenes: fxml files

StartWindow and ProjectWindow are exceptions from general rule of managing windows in this project.
They are just different views of same window (main program window), but same logic applies to them, so that's why.

Generally, controllers should not be called directly from other parts of program (only inside SideWindow methods).
SideWindow's methods should be used instead (it's safer).
Also, all methods and fields inside SideWindow should be static.
Also, class itself should be abstract (later it may be changed to private constructor).
